list-large-objects
------------------

`git-list-large-blobs.py` reports blobs larger than a configurable threshold in
the current repository. It is helpful when cleaning up history after
accidentally committing large assets.

Usage examples::

    # List blobs larger than the default 5MiB
    ./git-list-large-blobs.py

    # List blobs at or above 1GiB
    ./git-list-large-blobs.py --min-size 1GiB

The script uses `git rev-list --objects --all` and `git cat-file --batch-check`
to discover blob sizes, so it does not require additional Python dependencies.
